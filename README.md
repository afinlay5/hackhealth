# hackhealth

HackHealth is a rookie project that myself and Isaiah Harrison created as a competition entry in the 2017 Spring Hack PSU Programming Hackathon (a Major League Hacking event).
This project attempted to provide dietary suggestions by making REST calls to the Nutrionix API based on user input.
The project is written using Angular2 (JavaScript) and JavaFX 8(Java).

This project will almost certainly not be updated. It is here to demonstrate our work in the Hackathon :).
